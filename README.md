# Rueppell
Rueppell -- is a fox species living in the Middle-East, Southwestern Asia and, more importantly for us, North Africa -- but it's also our universal community website. From the ground up.
## How will it be done ?
### Static Website Generator
Our use of a Static Website Generator is motivated by our desire to have a CMS-free website and tighten our control of the content as well as our website's security. By having static webpages, we also get rid of real-time data and customized content for users, but that's not really a bad thing since we do not plan to use much of that.
### And what are Static Website Generators
Static Website Generator are used to generate static webpages by taking plain files and applying layouts to them. The end result will be a HTML file that will be sent to the website visitor. 
### Which Static Website Generator engine are we going to use ?
We're still looking for one ! Jekyll is ruled out for now, but no worries, so many more are available !
